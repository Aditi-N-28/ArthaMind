Now generate the full ArthaMind app with all pages, components, and logic exactly as defined below. IMPORTANT: Do not recreate the project. Only ADD files into the existing Vite React project.

[ArthaMind (Premium Feature Build)
You are building a full-stack web application called ArthaMind — an intelligent, gamified financial guide powered by AI.
The integrated chatbot assistant is named Maarg.
The app should use:
React (Vite or Create React App) for the front-end
Tailwind CSS for styling
Firebase Auth (preferred) or Clerk/Auth0 for authentication
Firestore (Firebase) for persistent storage (user profiles, XP, coins, expenses, savings, and chat logs)
Gemini API placeholder for Maarg’s AI logic (use mock responses for now)
The goal is to generate a fully working, structured webapp with the following features and layout:

Authentication (Login & Signup)
Pages: /signup and /login
Allow signup via email or phone number, password, and full name.
Use Firebase Authentication or Clerk/Auth0 (third-party auth).
Password generation & secure storage handled by the chosen auth provider.
Once authenticated, direct users to the Personal Credentials setup page.

Personal Credentials Page
Route: /personal
Greet the user with:
"Hi [UserName], welcome to ArthaMind. Kindly fill your personal credentials."
Collect:
Date of Birth (DOB) → auto-generate and display Age.
Gender (dropdown).
On submission → save to Firestore under users/{uid}/personalData.
Redirect to Financial Credentials page.

Financial Credentials Page
Route: /financial
Collect:
Monthly Salary (numeric input).
Key Expense breakdowns (number inputs or sliders):
Personal
Medical
Housing
Loan/Debt Payments
Monthly Savings:
Goal Amount (maximum/minimum enforced; if exceeded, show a warning toast).
Current Monthly Savings (saved so far).
Remaining to Save = Goal Amount − Current.
Save all data to Firestore (users/{uid}/financialData).

Auto-generate charts on dashboard:
Pie chart: Expenses distribution (Chart.js or Recharts).
Horizontal bar chart: Savings progress (goal vs. current).
Redirect to Dashboard.

Dashboard Page
Route: /dashboard
The dashboard will have a split layout:
Left Sidebar (narrow):
User Profile Section:
Name, Gender, Age
Salary (monthly)
Key expenses overview (no chart)
Gamification Section:
XP level (Level 1–10)
Coin balance
Right Main Panel (wide):
Pie Chart: Expense breakdown (personal, medical, housing, loan/debt).
Horizontal Bar Chart: Goal amount vs. current savings (auto-updated).
Financial News Section:
Integrate free financial news API (or mock JSON feed).
Auto-refresh daily tips/updates.
Bottom Right Corner: Floating button — “Chat with Maarg ”
Clicking it opens a chatbot popup modal.

Maarg Chatbot (Premium Feature)
Purpose: An intelligent financial AI assistant integrated into ArthaMind.
The chatbot will be an expandable pop-up modal or side window component with the following capabilities:

A. Core AI Engine (Gemini & Context)
Function: Answer questions and provide expert advice.
Mechanism:
Takes the user’s question and combines it with their personal and financial context (salary, expenses, savings).
Sends this combined context to the Gemini API (use mock endpoint for now).
Example queries:
“Should I take a loan or save first?”
“Explain SIP and which one suits me.”
“Suggest an Avalanche vs. Snowball repayment plan for my debts.”

B. Adaptive Learning Engine (Quizzes & Tracking)
Tracks the topic tag of each question asked (like “SIP,” “loan,” “tax”).
If the same topic appears 2+ times, Maarg sends a proactive message:
"I notice you’ve been asking about SIPs frequently. Would you like me to generate a short quiz to strengthen your understanding?"
Stores tags in Firestore under users/{uid}/learningHistory.

C. Gamification Engine (XP & Coins)
Each meaningful interaction updates counters in Firestore:
coins +10 when user finishes a quiz or completes a milestone.
xp +5 for every valid financial query.
Display XP and Coins on the Dashboard’s left panel.
Trigger toast notifications like:
" Great job, you just earned 5 XP and 10 Coins!"

Autonomous Financial Goal Planner (via Maarg)
This is Maarg’s premium conversational feature replacing traditional input forms.

It uses the user’s stored context (salary, savings, expenses, goals) to simulate an AI-powered planner.

When user says something like:

“I want to save ₹5,00,000 in 3 years for a car,”
Maarg responds with:

Required monthly SIP or savings target.

Smart Fund Mapping (Equity/Debt based on timeline).

Feasibility message (e.g., “Your current savings rate meets 72% of the target.”).

System Instruction for Gemini API Call (as required output):

You are Maarg, an expert AI financial mentor integrated into ArthaMind.
Your goal is to provide actionable, personalized financial guidance for the user.
Always use the user’s hidden context (salary, savings, expenses, goals) to generate intelligent advice.
Behave as the user’s autonomous financial planner.
1. When the user sets a new goal, calculate monthly savings needed (SIP).
2. When asked about loans, explain eligibility, repayment strategy (Avalanche/Snowball).
3. When asked for investment advice, suggest risk-matched options based on time horizon.
4. When noticing repeated topics, recommend a learning quiz (Adaptive Learning Engine).
5. Reward user actions by triggering XP/coin increments in the Gamification Engine.
Keep answers friendly, concise, and India-specific where relevant.

UI & Theming

Use Tailwind CSS for sleek financial aesthetic (gradient blues & greens).

Dashboard layout must be responsive and clean (grid/flex).

Add ArthaMind logo top-left and subtle tagline:
“Your path to smarter money decisions, guided by Maarg.”

Technical Requirements

Environment: Replit React environment.

Dependencies: firebase, chart.js, react-chartjs-2, react-toastify, axios, tailwindcss.

Use Firestore collections:

users → personalData, financialData, xp, coins

learningHistory

chatHistory

Keep Gemini integration modular in MaargService.js (mock API placeholder).

Provide comments in code for each major section.

Include a “Premium Feature” badge or lock icon next to Maarg in UI.

Deliverables

Generate a complete React + Tailwind + Firebase project with:

Functional signup/login

Personal + Financial credential input

Dashboard with profile + XP + coins + charts + news section

Floating AI chatbot (“Chat with Maarg ”) modal

Integrated logic scaffolds for Gemini API, XP/coins, and quiz detection.

The output should include:

Full React component structure (each page/component in its own file).

Sample Firestore data schema.

Mock Gemini API service file.

Tailwind layout and dashboard styling.

The final code must be ready to run in Replit as a self-contained React app, with Firebase config placeholders for easy setup.


Now generate each React component file in the project structure you just defined.]
